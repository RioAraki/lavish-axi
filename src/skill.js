# Lavish

${skillCommandText(home.description)}

You do not need lavish-axi installed globally - invoke it with \`npx -y lavish-axi <html-file>\`.
If lavish-axi output shows a follow-up command starting with \`lavish-axi\`, run it as \`npx -y lavish-axi ...\` instead.
In restricted subprocess sandboxes, CI, or agent harnesses where \`npx -y\` exits opaquely (for example with status 216), use an already-installed copy directly: \`node "$(npm root)/lavish-axi/dist/cli.mjs" <html-file>\` for a local install, \`node "$(npm root -g)/lavish-axi/dist/cli.mjs" <html-file>\` for a global install, or the bare \`lavish-axi <html-file>\` bin after installing once.

## Request

$ARGUMENTS

If the request above is non-empty, the user invoked \`/lavish\` explicitly - build an HTML artifact for that request now, following the workflow below.
If it is empty, infer what to visualize from the conversation.

## When to use

${home.help[home.help.length - 1]}

## Workflow

1. Create the HTML artifact (default location \`.lavish/<name>.html\` in the working directory).
2. Run \`npx -y lavish-axi <html-file>\` to display it in the browser. The command returns as soon as the page is open.
3. If it returns \`layout_warnings\`, repair the severe failure it reports and re-run the command to re-check before telling the user the page is ready.
4. Tell the user the page is open and summarize what it shows. Lavish collects nothing - the user replies to you in this conversation, not in the browser.
5. When they ask for changes, edit the artifact file. The open page live-reloads, so there is no command to re-run and nothing to poll, watch, or keep alive.

## Visual guidance

${bullets(home.visual_guidance)}

## Playbooks

Run \`npx -y lavish-axi playbook <id>\` for focused, detailed guidance on any of these.
${PLAYBOOK_ROUTER_HELP}
For flows, architecture, state, or sequence diagrams, do not hand-build boxes-and-arrows from div/flexbox; open the diagram playbook and use the theme-aware Mermaid snippet from \`npx -y lavish-axi design\` unless SVG is needed for richly annotated nodes.
